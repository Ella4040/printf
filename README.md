# Printf Team Project

As widely acknowledged, cooperation holds great significance in education, technology, and personal life. Despite our awareness of its importance, it is often tempting to prioritize our individual productivity over actively involving our partner.

With the intention of ensuring our responsibility and active involvement, this group project will emphasize a significant requirement for equal contribution.

**Cohort** : 15 SE ALX program

**Project Duration:**
- Start date : 23 June 2023
- End date : 28 June 2023

## Project description :

We'll start first by explaining printf function in C language, it's a function from the C standard library "stdio.h" and it can allow formatting the output in numerous ways thanks to the format specifiers :

    - %d : for printing integers
    - %f : for printing floating-point numbers
    - %c : for printing characters
    - %s : for printing strings
    - %p : for printing memory addresses
    - %x : for printing hexadecimal values

Our objective for this project is to establish a GitHub repository named "_ printf" and systematically complete all the assigned tasks in accordance with the specified requirements. The primary aim is to develop a function that closely resembles the printf function, enabling it to perform similar tasks. To ensure accuracy and reliability, we will incorporate various tests to cover possible cases and subsequently upload them to our project repository under the folder "test".
